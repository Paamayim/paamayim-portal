Once upon a time in PHP (maybe like 2007?) I wrote a web portal to do all of those things we used to want to do on the internet. It was more of an exercise in building big complicated systems than for usefulness.

Believe it or not, there are a few websites in existence which still run on this software. Oh god, the humanity.

Pushing this to the public mostly because I want a journal of how my ability to program has increased over the years. Any cursory look at this and, yep, it sure has. Thank god.

If you're an employer, you're not allowed to judge me on this =)
